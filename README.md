# Smart-Text-Editor
Python command line text editor with some cool features like spelling and grammar checks (with suggestions for how to fix), and even plagiarism detection. Once you're done editing your file, you can share it via email as well. Made this for my final project in my AP CS Principles class (a little overkill, but it was fun).

I've also included a few sample txt files that I used while presenting this project to demonstrate the features.
