# Smart-Text-Editor
Python command line text editor with some cool features like spelling and grammar checks (with suggestions for how to fix), and even plagiarism detection. Once you're done editing your file, you can share it via email as well. I also later implemented multithreading to the plagiarism detection to prevent it from running painfully slow.

I've also included a few sample txt files that I used while presenting this project to demonstrate the features.
