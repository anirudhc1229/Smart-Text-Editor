Yesterday, I read a book called To Kill a Mockingbird for English class. It was not very interesting. I also figured out a new way to filter lists in Python, which was pretty interesting. Some other interesting things happened too: I saw an interesting show on TV about a man who suddenly goes blind one day. Overall, I had a pretty interesting day.
