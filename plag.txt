In the nineteenth century, Europe's Industrial Revolution took place, rapidly transforming socioeconomic structures. After observing big businesses spreading throughout urban areas, the
 upper-middle-class migrated from the countryside to become employers, and the lower-middle-class to become employees. Business was booming, but workers were forced to withstand low wages and poor conditions. Arguments that
 emerged over the course of the nineteenth century about how to improve the lives of European workers were centered around the ideas of socialism and capitalism. Capitalists believed the current system was adequate for all
 classes and that the government should not intervene, while socialists believed reform was necessary, through either government or public uprising.
